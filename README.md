This repository contains an OpenFOAM simulation of a spacecraft capsule (Apollo) at mach 5 speed.

To clone the repository, [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) is needed

The simulation has already been ran, but the repository also contains scripts to run the simulation in the [Deucalion Supercomputer](https://docs.macc.fccn.pt/), for example `sbatch x86-run-multinode.sh`

To open in ParaView, load the state file **apollo.foam**
